I am a full-stack software developer with over 15 years of product-focused experience in a number of roles within multinational companies. Following a career change into programming I now have a passion to craft new products in code, immerse myself in new technologies and continue to learn and grow as I do so. I am a graduate of Makers Academy where I have acquired the coding skills and techniques to help me on my way to becoming a world-class programmer.

I seek a role in which I can continue to create and deliver innovative and robust products in an Agile environment, manage product backlogs and collaborate with stakeholders across business and technology teams. As I have thoroughly enjoyed working with many software development teams in my career I would be very excited to join such a team. I have a strong desire to discover solutions to product challenges and I would feel empowered and rewarded to build those solutions in code.

## Background
I completed an undergraduate degree course in Engineering at Cambridge University and followed that with an MSc in Distributed Systems at the University of Kent. Since then I have worked in several technology roles for global companies and consumer brands. I am very glad to move into software development and continue my journey in technology. 

I have extensive commercial experience in web products. My last job was at an online gambling operator called Kindred whose main brand is Unibet. During my 6.5 years there the company more than doubled the number of customers and brands that it served. I was responsible for essential updates on the CMS (based on the Atex Polopoly platform) to support this expansion. I worked mainly on front-end deliverables for new products and features, optimising customer journeys and producing compelling landing pages for marketing teams.

Prior to this I worked on major mobile content retailing platforms for Vodafone customers in several markets. One of those was in Belgium for the Vodafone partner operating company called Proximus. I enjoyed a 3 year product manager role there mainly working on a music download product which was a key consumer offering on their upgraded data network. I also supported a large number of content providers in making their content available on their mobile content portal.

## Projects
| Title	| Description	| Technologies and frameworks | Duration |
|---	|---	|---	|--- |
| [What Zen](https://github.com/what-zen/what-zen-app) | For my final project at Makers our team of 5 built a task manager integrated with chat. It allows its community of users to manage tasks using a simple format which followed the Eisenhower Matrix, and chat about the tasks or issues in general. It is deployed at https://what-zen-app.firebaseapp.com/ 	| JavaScript, React, Node.js, Cypress, Travis CI, Firebase | 2 weeks	|
| [Acebook](https://github.com/dippedincode/acebook-desk-warriors) | This was my second team project at Makers, there were 4 of us in the team. The task was to build a clone of facebook. This time new requirements were given to us by the 'product owner' in Makers halfway through the project so we had to react in a very agile way to meet them. | Ruby, Rails, RSpec, Heroku, Travis CI, Heroku | 2 weeks |
| [MakersBnB](https://github.com/dippedincode/Makers_BnB)	| This was my first team project at Makers and it introduced me to the prevalent Agile methodologies. 5 of us built a clone of Airbnb, starting from initial concept and design, early MVP, several iterations of product and features through to final delivery in a very short timeframe. | Ruby, Active Record ORM, RSpec, Travis CI, Heroku | 1 week	|
| [Thermostat](https://github.com/dippedincode/Thermostat) | This was a project done as a pair programming challenge. I ensured that my pair and I initially did some object and process modelling before writing any code. This saved us a lot of time as we could transfer methods straight from our diagram into code and have a common reference which aided collaboration. | JavaScript, jQuery, Jasmine	| 4 days |
| [Connect 4](https://github.com/dippedincode/Connect4)	| This is my solution to a [codewars kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/connect-4/) which models the game Connect 4. It is an ongoing project and I have been evolving the game algorithms over time. I have tested many scenarios for winning lines and it has been an excellent exercise in TDD. | JavaScript, Node.js, Jasmine	| ongoing	|

In between certain roles I dedicated my time towards raising my children and in earlier years I spent time travelling in order to experience new cultures and landscapes. This has all helped me to grow as a person and broaden my perspectives.

## Interests
- **Sport**: I play football, squash and table tennis, and I am a keen follower of football, cricket and a few other sports. I support a very successful club from my home city of Manchester and I give the Premier League most of my attention, but I am also very interested in lower levels of football in England and in Spain's La Liga.
Researching and collecting classic football shirts is another passion of mine and I have a passion for the design elements and nostalgia that prevail in this hobby.  

- **Music**: I enjoy attending music concerts when I can and I follow both established and new artists online. Since London offers many opportunities to see performers in all types of venues I enjoy both intimate concerts in small rooms and world famous acts in large arenas in equal measure. I am an ardent fan of certain brands of guitar music. Recently I discovered the bluegrass genre which is an exciting combination of roots, blues and jazz.     

Any other free time I have is taken up with caring for and entertaining my two young children and in turn my wife and wider community of family and friends.
