## Profile
I am a full-stack software developer specialising in Java and my most recent role was as a developer for an asset finance software company. I am a graduate of Makers Academy where I have acquired the coding skills and techniques to help me on my way to becoming a world-class programmer. I also have over 10 years of web product experience in a number of roles within multinational companies. Following a career change into programming I now have a passion to craft software, immerse myself in new technologies and continue to learn and grow.

I completed an undergraduate degree course in Engineering at Cambridge University and followed that with an MSc in Distributed Systems at the University of Kent. Since then I have worked in several web product roles for global companies and consumer brands. One of my product roles was at an online gambling operator in which I was responsible for delivering new products and features, optimising customer journeys and producing compelling landing pages for marketing teams. Prior to this I worked on mobile content retailing platforms for Vodafone customers in several markets.

My last role was as a Junior Software Engineer at Alfa Systems which is a leading provider of asset finance software, and it was my first since graduating from Makers Acadmey. In this role I delivered bug fixes and product enhancements to their Java siftware platform, putting into practice the skills I have gained in my training. I am seeking a new role in which I can build on my experience and continue delivering product solutions.    

## Projects
| Title	| Description	| Technologies and frameworks | Duration |
|---	|---	|---	|--- | 
| [What Zen](https://github.com/what-zen/what-zen-app) | For my final project at Makers our team of 5 built a task manager integrated with chat. It allows its community of users to manage tasks using a simple format which followed the Eisenhower Matrix, and chat about the tasks or issues in general. It is deployed at https://what-zen-app.firebaseapp.com/ 	| JavaScript, React, Node.js, Cypress, Travis CI, Firebase | 2 weeks	|
| [Acebook](https://github.com/dippedincode/acebook-desk-warriors) | This was my second team project at Makers, there were 4 of us in the team. The task was to build a clone of facebook. This time new requirements were given to us by the 'product owner' in Makers halfway through the project so we had to react in a very agile way to meet them. | Ruby, Rails, RSpec, Heroku, Travis CI, Heroku | 2 weeks |
| [MakersBnB](https://github.com/dippedincode/Makers_BnB)	| This was my first team project at Makers and it introduced me to the prevalent Agile methodologies. 5 of us built a clone of Airbnb, starting from initial concept and design, early MVP, several iterations of product and features through to final delivery in a very short timeframe. | Ruby, Active Record ORM, RSpec, Travis CI, Heroku | 1 week	|
| [Thermostat](https://github.com/dippedincode/Thermostat) | This was a project done as a pair programming challenge. I ensured that my pair and I initially did some object and process modelling before writing any code. This saved us a lot of time as we could transfer methods straight from our diagram into code and have a common reference which aided collaboration. | JavaScript, jQuery, Jasmine	| 4 days |
| [Connect 4](https://github.com/dippedincode/Connect4)	| This is my solution to a [codewars kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/connect-4/) which models the game Connect 4. It is an ongoing project and I have been evolving the game algorithms over time. I have tested many scenarios for winning lines and it has been an excellent exercise in TDD. | JavaScript, Node.js, Jasmine	| ongoing	|
